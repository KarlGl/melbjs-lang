Rather than putting in a fucntion I made a new class called 'variableResolver'


variable = false or 2

expect{ test }.to raise_error do |e|
  e.message.should eq("message")
end

our code block is being passed to the to method, not to the raise error method.
if we used curly braces instead of do-end it would pass.

"poetry mode"

Code is poetry?

Who is this actually helping?

Who gives a fuck about poety? Poets. Non-programmers?

Is "sugar" actually meaningfull symantics?

var x = true;
(function self() {
	if (x) {
		return self();
	}
})();


Indentation forced languages.

Anyone here not do the exact same indentation all the time for all thier code?
You're already doing it!
